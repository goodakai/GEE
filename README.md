**Abstract**

Mapping Himalayan leucogranite based on multi-source remote sensing data and Google Earth Engine platform.

-   The GEE computation platform provides online JavaScript and Python Application Programming Interfaces, so there are two code files based on different APIs.
-   The input data were three vector files containing the study area region, and the remote sensing data were called from the GEE cloud server.
-   The input results are TIF files saved to Google Cloud Drive, mapped according to the probability that each pixel point in the study area is a Himalayan leucogranite, which can be displayed online.
